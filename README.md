# Contact form with React and Formik

This is a simple contact form with React. The contact form uses formik as a primary package to validate form fields. I have explained two different types of implementation (textfield and checkbox) in the project. The textfield is a custom made form field and checkbox is a component imported from material-ui. The validation is done by using Yup.

Documentation: https://formik.org/docs/api/field, https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html, https://formik.org/docs/examples/with-material-ui, https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup

Flaticons: https://www.flaticon.com/ (Free)

To run the project: clone and navigate to root of the project and execute `npm i`. Then run `npm start` to run locally. open the console window to look at the entered form values.
